# ArielNikas-HumoralMemoryEnhancingInfection
This code is associated with the paper "When does humoral memory enhance infection?", currently submitted to Plos Computational Biology. 

This code follows the outline of the paper going over: in vitro addition of passive antibodies, in vivo addition of passive antibodies,  cross-reactive antibodies, non-antibody immune response, and combinations of parameters. 

Each chunk is labelled with the figure it corresponds to beginning with Figure 2 (Figure 1 was a schematic). Figure subpanels from digitized data are labeled and at the end.
